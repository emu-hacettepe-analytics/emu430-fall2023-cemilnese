**Summary**

We will utilize three datasets provided by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.

The first dataset, titled **\"Earthquake Scenario Analysis Results\"**, contains the outcomes of analyses conducted based on a 7.5 Mw nighttime earthquake scenario.

The second dataset, **\"Neighborhood-Based Building Numbers in 2017\"**, comprises information on the number of buildings in Istanbul\'s neighborhoods. These buildings are categorized by their construction year and the number of floors.

The third dataset is **\"Municipality Population in 2019\"**, contains population of Istanbul by districts in 2019.

Our objective is to compile a comprehensive report and identify the districts in Istanbul that are most susceptible to potential earthquakes. We aim to create an ordered priority list for neighborhoods and develop a risk map for Istanbul, taking geographical coordinates into account.
